This folder contains the following files:

Global_410-0Ma_Rotations_2019_v3_${timescale}.rot - This file contains the rotation model that is consistent with the present day age grid.
Global_EarthByte_${timescale}_Isochrons_2019_v3.gpml - This file contains the seafloor spreading isochrons.
Global_EarthByte_${timescale}_IsoCOB_2019_v3.gpml - This file contains the continent-ocean boundaries as line segments.
Global_EarthByte_${timescale}_Ridges_2019_v3.gpml - This file contains present and extinct mid-ocean ridges.
Global_EarthByte_${timescale}_COB_Terranes_2019_v3.gpml - This file contains the polygons needed to make the masking polygon.
