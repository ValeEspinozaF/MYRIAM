git clone https://github.com/ValeEspinozaF/MYRIAM.git
cd MYRIAM
git checkout main                   # or whichever branch is preferred
git pull                            # fetch all recent changes from this branch

## Dependencies

MYRIAM calculations run as a self-contained release, and require no additional dependencies. However, to generate PNG figures you will need Python and the following packages:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) or later
- [Pandas 1.4.4](https://https://pandas.pydata.org/) or later
- [Matplotlib 3.5](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html) or later
- [Cartopy 0.18.0](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html#getting-started) or later, 
- and dependencies therein*

*Note that Cartopy up to version 0.21.0 may encounter package issues when importing, particularly *lgeos*. Make sure to install/downgrade Shapely to its version 1.8.5 to avoid the above issue.
